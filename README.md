# File-Transfer-Model
Simple model of file transmission between central and branch offices using magma algorythm to encrypt and decrypt data.

# About
This project is nothing but the model of how the files can be transmitted between instances of offices, using sockets and magma algo for data encryption. I made it for my graduation work and it can be improved in many ways, but it will probably stay like this forever.

# Requirements
Python 3.10+ PyQT5, pygost, pycryptodome, openpyxl
